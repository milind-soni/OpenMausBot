// Notifications — what is worth interrupting someone for.
//
// `BotRecord.notifications` has been a switch in the settings panel that
// nothing read. This is the thing that reads it. The rule it encodes is
// small and deliberate: a bot that is *blocked on you* is worth a buzz, and
// a bot that *finished* is worth one if you asked for it; everything else a
// bot does while it works is not.
//
// A turn that dies before it starts is the first case, not the last: the
// bot is not working, and the fix is usually a setting only a person can
// change, so a retry cannot clear it. A routine failure already buzzed;
// this makes an interactive turn behave the same way.
//
// Delivery is a separate concern. The harness emits a frame; whoever is
// listening decides what to do with it — desktop and paired-phone local
// notifications today, and closed-app APNs delivery once a relay exists.
