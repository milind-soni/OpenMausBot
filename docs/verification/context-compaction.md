# Conversation context compaction

Long direct conversations can summarize older exchanges before the next turn.
The full transcript, its branches and attachments are retained. The new session
gets a bounded summary plus recent exchanges; later turns resume that session.
A visible, expandable note explains what was summarized, even with tool chips off.

## Exercise the real path

```sh
pnpm exec vitest run server/context-compaction.e2e.test.ts
pnpm exec vitest run server/pinned-instructions.test.ts
pnpm exec vitest run server/context-rebuild.test.ts server/compaction-summary.test.ts server/context-budget.test.ts server/delta-context.e2e.test.ts
pnpm exec vitest run server/store.test.ts server/config.test.ts src/components/DigestChip.test.ts
pnpm test:packaged-server
```

The API fixture launches the shared isolated server and fake engine. It uses
`control-omb` for create, send, wait, edit and Stop. Its new manual operation is
`POST /api/bots/:id/compact` with `{ "threadId": "owned-thread-id" }`; this uses
normal turn admission, returns 202, and completes through that thread's ordinary
busy/idle state. The route accepts no agent-written summary or file path.
There is not yet a dedicated manual-compaction button in the app.

Evidence covers:

- Automatic compaction keeps the two latest exchanges and the incoming request.
- A completed turn retains the driver's latest-prompt measurement, separately from summed input tokens.
- Claude compaction leaves headroom before the selected account's numeric native threshold, including after a previous compaction; `auto` and `off` do not invent a numeric native limit.
- Manual compaction executes no additional agent turn and retains the original messages.
- A repeated request at the same compacted tip is a no-op.
- Restart before the next send retains the summary and replaces the native session once.
- A later send keeps that replacement session instead of injecting the summary again.
- Editing an old message replays its selected branch, not the abandoned summary.
- Stop aborts a hanging helper without a late record; a new send still works.
- Private session bookkeeping stays off the task wire shape; stored summaries redact secrets.
- A pinned instruction pack is re-injected from the system prompt after
  compaction, the folded exchange stays inside the bounded summary, and
  disabling the pack removes it from the next turn.

Each API fixture retains exact requests, waits and bounded transcripts in
`<server-log>.context.json`, prints that location, and closes its exact child and
temporary home. No live account, computer or user workspace is touched.

## Pinned instruction packs

Pinned packs are person-authored instruction blocks that survive compaction.
Each pack is a markdown file with `name`, `description` and optional `role` /
`workspace` frontmatter, managed through `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` on
`/api/bots/:id/pinned/:name`. Packs ride the system prompt, which the rebuilt
session re-sends every turn, so a pack is present before and after compaction
without being copied into the summary. Disabling a pack removes it from the very
next turn, compaction or not.

Conditions are static and inspectable: `role` matches the bot's title
case-insensitively and `workspace` matches a turn working directory at or below
an absolute path on segment boundaries. Nothing in the conversation can pin,
edit or drop a pack. The routes are person-facing only, pack bytes are hashed at
save time, and a workspace file edit that changes the hash blocks injection
until the person saves the pack again. Allowlist state (enabled flag, version,
provenance) lives in `DATA_DIR/pinned-state/<botId>/pinned.json`, and injected
packs share a 16 KiB budget; an over-budget pack is omitted by name, never
truncated. This slice ships `role` and `workspace` conditions; there is no
static task-type field on tasks to match yet.

## Bounds and limitations

`context` settings in config.json are optional. `autoCompact: false` disables
automatic folding, `compactAt` is a fraction below 1 or a token count, and
`rebuildBytes` controls replay size (default 24,000 bytes). Context-only settings
do not reload provider processes. The default threshold is 80% of the known
model window; a real latest-prompt measurement wins over a transcript estimate.
Summed input tokens across tool rounds are never treated as context size.
For Claude, the threshold and post-compaction regrowth floor also leave 10%
headroom below the selected account's numeric native-compaction setting.
That account's setting takes precedence over the inherited launch environment.
Native `auto`/`off` settings supply no known numeric bound; other engines keep
their own model-window threshold. The native CLI setting itself is unchanged.

The selected account's tool-free helper can produce a historical summary, with
a 20-second timeout and source-labelled fallback when unavailable. Summaries
are capped at 6,000 bytes and retain recent source corrections. The helper may
incur provider usage; its one-shot cost is not separately reported by the current
provider interface. Summaries are not verified facts and can omit details.

This slice covers direct threads. It does not add channel compaction, change
provider-native compaction, prove live-model summary quality, or ship native
iOS/Android compaction controls. The renderer test checks note markup and escaping,
not a real browser click. Native mobile indicators remain separate PR work.
