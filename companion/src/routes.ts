// What a paired device is allowed to ask for.
//
// The default is deny, and that direction is the whole point: the sidecar
// sits in front of an API it does not own and cannot see the future of. A
// route that appears in the harness later is closed to phones until someone
// decides otherwise, because the alternative is that every upstream release
// silently widens what a lost phone can reach.
//
// This file used to claim that and not do it — it listed refusals and let
// everything else under `/api/` through. In the time between writing it and
// noticing, upstream added webhook triggers, connected-app authorisation and
// routines, all of which a paired phone could drive: minting an
// internet-reachable trigger, rotating a signing secret out from under
// whatever was sending to it, disconnecting a Google account. None of that
// was a decision anyone made. It was the default.
//
// So the list below is the surface, derived from what the app actually
// calls. Adding a feature to the phone means adding its route here, on
// purpose, in a diff someone can read. That cost is the feature.
